# DC-Motor
You will run DC motor and control its direction and speed by Arduino.
You are required to create a circuit with an Arduino board, a DC motor, L293D Motor
Driver IC, potentiometer and push button using Arduino Software (IDE).
When you correctly assembled the circuit, you will need to write a source code to
control the speed of the DC motor by the potentiometer and motorâ€™s direction by the
button. 
Firstly DC motor will rotate clockwise for 3 seconds and counterclockwise for 3 seconds.
But when push-button is pressed, it should rotate reverse direction regardless of time duration. 
Also potentiometer will be used to speed up or slow down DC motor.
